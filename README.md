# 💪 Sujal Gym Webpage

Welcome to the **Sujal Gym** project — a beginner-friendly gym landing page I created when I was just starting to learn web development!

## 🛠️ About the Project

This project was one of my very first attempts at creating a complete webpage using **HTML**, **CSS**, and a bit of **inline styling**. It's a gym-themed landing page with a fun and colorful aesthetic, featuring:

- A **navigation bar** with Home, About Us, Contact, and Blog links  
- A **header section** with a logo and action buttons (Email, Call Us)  
- A **"Join With Us" form** that allows users to enter their name, gender, age, and email  
- Basic styling and layout done using fonts from Google Fonts and some inline CSS  
- Background image and stylized form container for visual appeal  

## 📂 Files Included


- `about.html`: Main HTML file with embedded CSS  
- `style.css`: Linked but not used in the current version (can be expanded for cleaner code)  
- `img/use.jpg`, `img/gym-logo-removebg-preview.png`: Image assets used in background and header  

## 🚧 Note

> This webpage was built during the early days of my web development journey. It may not be responsive or follow best practices, but it represents the enthusiasm and curiosity I had while learning. ✨

## 📈 What I Learned

- Structuring web pages with HTML  
- Basic inline and internal CSS styling  
- Creating forms and layouts  
- Using Google Fonts and images for UI enhancement
